# Functional-Programming-made-easy
This repo is here to provide an introduction to different functional programming concepts. The intention is to show how easy (and practical) functional programming (FP) can be. Since there are many advantages on FP, this should also be a motivation to start learning FP. Feel free to contribute!

# Why should I learn functional programming?
Currently functional programming is quite hyped. Most languages implement more and more functional concepts in each version. One reason for it is Moore's law

## Who should read this?
All who want to learn something about functional programming! This course is intended to be build on your existing knowledge and guide you to the core concepts of functional programming.

## Prerequisites
I assume that you have already have basic understanding in some programming language. You should be familiar with imperative and some OOP principles.

## Examples
Examples are provided in C# and/or F#. If I find the time I will also add examples in Scala and Haskell. Generally the language doesnt matter to show the principles. However in the beginning its easier to have examples in a familiar language.
