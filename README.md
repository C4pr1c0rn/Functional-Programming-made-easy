# Functional-Programming-made-easy
This repo is here to provide an introduction to different functional programming concepts. The intention is to show how easy (and practical) functional programming (FP) can be. Since there are many advantages on FP, this should also be a motivation to start learning FP. Feel free to contribute!


## Prerequisites
I assume that you have already have basic understanding in some programming language. You should be familiar with imperative and some OOP principles.

## Examples
Examples are provided in C# and/or F#. If I find the time I will also add examples in Scala and Haskell. Generally the language doesnt matter to show the principles. However in the beginning its easier to have examples in a familiar language.

## Outline

### 01 - Basics
